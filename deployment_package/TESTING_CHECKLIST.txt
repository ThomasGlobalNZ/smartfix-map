SMARTFIX MAP - TESTING CHECKLIST
================================

Open the map in your browser and check these 5 things:

1. CHECK THE MAP LOADS
   - Do you see the map of New Zealand?
   - Do you see blue and green dots (stations)?

2. CHECK THE LAYERS (Top Left Icon)
   - Click the layer icon (square stack).
   - Click "Satellite". Does the background become an aerial photo?
   - Switch back to "Standard".

3. CHECK A STATION
   - Click any colored dot.
   - A box should pop up with the Station Name and Port Number.
   - It should also show the "Est. Baseline Error".

4. TEST THE TOOLS (Top Right Buttons)
   - Click the "Ruler" icon. Click two points on the map. It should measure distance.
   - Click the "Target" icon. Enter "20". It should draw green rings around all stations.

5. CHECK COORDINATES (Bottom Left)
   - Move your mouse. The numbers in the bottom-left corner should change.
   - Click the numbers to switch between Lat/Lon and NZTM.

If all of these work, the deployment is successful.
