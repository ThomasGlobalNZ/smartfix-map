QUESTIONS FOR IT ADMIN
======================

Please ask the IT administrator the following questions to ensure the map is deployed correctly:

1. WHAT IS THE URL?
   - What will be the final web address for the map?
   - Example: https://globalsurvey.co.nz/smartfix

2. IS HTTPS ENABLED?
   - Does the server support HTTPS?
   - This is important for the "Find My Location" (GPS) feature to work on mobile devices.

3. HOW DO I UPDATE DATA?
   - If I generate new station data files in the future, how should I send them to you?
   - Can I email them, or is there a specific folder/FTP I should upload to?
