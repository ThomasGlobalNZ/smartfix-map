HOW TO TEST ON YOUR PHONE (LOCAL WIFI)
======================================

1. ENSURE CONNECTION
   Make sure your phone and this PC are on the same Wi-Fi network.

2. FIND YOUR PC's IP ADDRESS
   - On this PC, open a terminal (Command Prompt).
   - Type `ipconfig` and press Enter.
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.50).

3. OPEN ON PHONE
   - On your phone's browser (Chrome/Safari), type:
     http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000/app/index.html
     
     Example: http://192.168.1.50:8000/app/index.html

4. VERIFY MOBILE LAYOUT
   - Check that the controls (search box, buttons) fit on the screen.
   - Check that the "Coordinate Box" moves to the bottom and looks good.
   - Try using two fingers to pinch/zoom the map.

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
*   **Can't Load?** It is likely the Windows Firewall blocking the connection.
    1.  On your PC, a popup might have appeared asking to allow Python. Click "Allow/Public".
    2.  If no popup: Search Windows for "Firewall & network protection" -> "Allow an app through firewall" -> Ensure `python.exe` is checked for Private/Public.
*   **Different WiFi?** Your phone and laptop MUST be on the same Wireless network. If your laptop is on a cable (Ethernet) and phone is on WiFi, it might not work depending on the router setting.
